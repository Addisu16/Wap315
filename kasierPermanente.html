                <h1>TOTAL HEALTH SOLUTIONS</h1>
                <p>
                    Our medical and dental teams work as a team to help protect the total health of our members. Shared
                    health records mean our dentists see when members are due for medical screenings and can help
                    schedule their appointment right away. In fact, did you know that Kaiser Permanente members with
                    both medical and dental coverage weigh less, smoke less, and visit the hospital and emergency
                    department less often than members with just medical coverage?2 Learn more about our COVID-19 safety
                    measures and what to expect
                    at your next dental
                    appointment.
